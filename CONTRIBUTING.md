# Contributing to Matha

First of all: thanks for considering contributing to **Matha**.  
This project is open-source, but it is **not unmoderated chaos**.

All contributions are reviewed. Merging is **not automatic**.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

Matha follows these rules:

- **Correctness over cleverness**
- **Performance over verbosity**
- **Clarity over ego**
- **No redundant re-implementations**
- **No breaking existing APIs without strong justification**

If your contribution violates any of these, it will be rejected. No hard feelings.

---

## ✅ What You Can Contribute

We welcome:

- New mathematical functions (well-defined and tested)
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Better numerical stability
- Cleaner APIs

---

## ❌ What Will Be Rejected

The following will be rejected immediately:

- Duplicate functionality already present in Matha
- Poorly named functions or variables
- Unexplained magic numbers
- Unverified algorithms
- “Looks cool” additions without mathematical value
- Breaking changes without discussion
- Code copied from other libraries without attribution

---

## 🧪 Code Standards

- Use **pure Python** unless NumPy is necessary
- Functions must be **deterministic**
- Add **docstrings** explaining:
  - what the function does
  - expected input types
  - return values
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies

If applicable, include:
- Time complexity
- Numerical limitations

## 🔀 Pull Request Rules

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a clear branch name  
   Example: `add-gamma-function`, `optimize-integral`
3. Submit a Pull Request with:
   - A short explanation
   - Mathematical justification (if relevant)
4. Be prepared to revise or defend your implementation

**The maintainer has full discretion** to accept, request changes, or reject any PR.

## 🧾 Licensing & Attribution

By submitting a contribution:

- You agree your code will be released under the **MIT License**
- You confirm the code is **your own work**
- You agree Matha may modify, refactor, or remove your contribution

---

## 🧠 Final Note

Matha aims to be a **serious, unified math utility library**, not a dumping ground.

If you care about mathematics, precision, and clean design — you’re welcome here.

If not — that’s fine too. Just don’t open a PR.
