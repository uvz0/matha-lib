# 🚀 matha — Math All Utilities  
### *One library to rule them all. Others may try. They will fail.*

**matha** is not a math library.  
It is a **hostile takeover** of the entire computational ecosystem.

If you’re tired of:
- Googling *“does NumPy have this?”*
- Importing `numpy`, `scipy`, `math`, `statistics`, and that cursed `utils_final_v3.py`
- Re-implementing the same formula like it’s a seasonal ritual

Then congratulations. You’ve reached the endgame.

**matha exists so you can stop importing libraries and start importing authority.**

## 🧠 Philosophy

> *Why remember where a function lives, when it should already be there?*

We believe:
- Math should be **centralized**
- APIs should be **predictable**
- Performance should be **intentional**
- And confusion should be **eliminated without mercy**

**We are not polite.  
We are not verbose.  
We are precise.**

## 🧾 Final Warning

Once you start using matha,
going back to fragmented math libraries will feel like:

> Writing assembly after tasting Python
> 
> Riding a bicycle after seeing a jet
> 
> Using a calculator after learning mental math 

You have been warned.

## 🔥 What’s Inside (And Why Others Should Be Nervous)

### 🧮 Universal Math Arsenal
From baby-tier:
- `mean`, `median`, `variance`

To “bro is building a space program”:
- `integral`, `derivative`, `limit`
- `eigenvalues`, `matrix ops`
- `poisson_pmf`, `gamma`, `combinatorics`

All under one namespace:

```python
import matha
```

Or the easy way:
```python
import matha as mth
```
Or the "hard" way:
```python
import matha as super_duper_ultimate_mathmatics_library_which_is_still_in_v1_but_has_mostly_everything_i_need
```

## Documentation
Sorry. Im too lazyy to write the whole documentation in this MD file.
what? you cant use it properly? 
Then it's okay! Just go to your desired function's file,
I have documented everything there! :)
